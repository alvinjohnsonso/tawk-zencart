# About tawk.to
tawk.to is a  free  live chat app that lets you monitor and  chat  with  visitors on your website
or from a free customizable page. No catch. No spam. No wares. It's truly free and always will be.

# Installation
Copy files to your Zen Cart directory. Zen Cart uses customized directories for admin
so you have to copy files from YOUR_ADMIN_FOLDER to folder where you have moved Zen Cart
admin files. Same thing applies to templates, copy includes/templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE content
to folder with template you are using

HINT: If you don't know what the template directory name you are using, then you can find it out by following these steps:
	1) Login to your Zen Cart admin dashboard.
	2) From the menu, Go to "Tools > Template Selection".
	3) From the screen that shows Template Selection, look under the column that is titled "Template Directory". The name you find under that column is the template directory name that your Zen Cart site is currently using. That EXACT name is the one that you will use to replace each instance of "includes/templates/YOUR_TEMPLATE_FOLDER_NAME".

# Usage
Go to administration page -> tools -> Tawk.to widget and select widget you want to use in your
Zen Cart store, selected widget will appear in all the pages of your store.
